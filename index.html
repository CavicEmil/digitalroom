        <h1>Save The Golden Spotlight Awards!</h1>
        <p class="bodytext">Tonight was supposed to be flawless.
            The Golden Spotlight Awards — the most glamorous night of the year.
            The lights were bright, the stage was set… and then, in a shocking twist, the award trophy vanished moments before the show began.
            Four people were backstage at the time of the disappearance.
            Four motives. Four stories. Only one truth.
        </p>

            <p class="bodytext">
                    The face of the ceremony — when he can find his cue cards.
                    Always rushing, always stressed, and always misplacing things.
                    He swears that “something shiny” slipped into his bag earlier… but now he can’t even find the bag.
                    Was it an accident? Or a panicked cover-up?

                    She doesn’t perform on stage — she owns it.
                    In her eyes, every award belongs to her by default.
                    She declared she would do “ANYTHING” to avoid losing to a newcomer tonight.
                    Is that just diva talk? Or a dangerous promise?

                    The wizard behind the scenes.
                    She controls the lights, screens, microphones — even the security systems.
                    She’s brilliant, underpaid, and almost invisible to the audience she supports.
                    Conveniently, the cameras began glitching right when the trophy disappeared.
                    Is she the hero of the show… or the mastermind behind the chaos?

                    A star who feels every emotion… loudly.
                    She believes the world never appreciates her “raw talent,” especially when others win awards she thinks should be hers.
                    Witnesses overheard her arguing about not being nominated — again.
                    Could her bruised ego have pushed her to sabotage the biggest night of the year?
